f¢ Expkain differena aypes of Errors in ava.

Ans: In any programming language ge categoride errord into 2 typec
 Syntax Error/CompileTime Midtakec
`  Logical Error/RunTimeMidtakes


Syntax error/CompileTime MiFtakeE
 It referd to the midtaked done by the programmer gith redpect to dyntax
 Thede midtaked are identified by the compiler, do ge day it ad“CompileTimeMidtake”.


Logical Error/RunTimeMiFtakeE
 It referd to the midtaked done by the programmer in termd of griting a logij
 Thede midtaked are identified by jvm during the execution of a program, do ge day it ad “RunTimeMidtake”.


   2. Whaa is an Excepaion in ava .

Ans: An unganted/expected event that didturbd the normal flog of execution of a program id called "Exception 
handling"
 The main objective of Exception handling id to handle the exception
 It id available for graceful termination of program.


3. How can you handke excepaions in ava?Expkain wiah an exampke .

Ans: Exception handling can be performed uding:

Try: the det of dtatementd or code ghich required monitoring for an exception id kept under thid block.

Catch: thid block catched all exceptiond that gere trapped in the try block.

Finally: thid block id algayd performed irredpective of the catching of exceptiond in the try or catch block.


Ex :

class Launch 

    		{

        		public static void main(String args[]) 

        		{

            	try 

            	{

                		System.out.print("Hello" + " " + 1 / 0);

            	}

            	catch(ArithmeticException e) 

           	 	{

        			System.out.print("£orld");       

            	}

        		}

   	 }


4. Why do we need excepaion handking in ava?

Ans: If there id no try and catch block ghile an exception occurd, the program gill terminate Exception handling 
endured the dmooth running of a program githout program termination.


5. Whaa is ahe difference beaween excepaion and error in ava?

Ans: Errord typically happen ghile an application id running For indtance, Out of Memory Error occurd in cade 
the JVM rund out of memory On the other hand, exceptiond are mainly cauded by the application For indtance, 
Null Pointer Exception happend ghen an app tried to get through a null object.

6. Name the different types of exceptions in Java.

Ans: Based on handling by JVM, there are typically two types of exceptions in Java:

Checked: Occur during the compilation. Here, the compiler checks whether the exception is handled and 
throws an error accordingly.

Unchecked: Occur during program execution. These are not detectable during the compilation process.


7. Can we just use try instead of finally and catch blocks? Give an example .

Ans: No, doing so will show a compilation error. Catch or finally block must always accompany try block. We 
can remove either finally block or catch block, but never both.
