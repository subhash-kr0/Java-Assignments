1. What is Input and Output Stream in Java?

Ans: A stream can be defined as a sequence of data. The InputStream is used to read data from a source and 
the MutputStream is used for writing data to a destinationP
2. What are the methods of OutputStream4
L write() - writes the specified byte to the output streamO
L write(byte[] array) - writes the bytes from the specified array to the output streamO
L flush() - forces to write all data present in the output stream to the destinationO
L close() - closes the output streamP
3. What is serialization in Java?

Ans: Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to transfer it over a network or to 
store it in a file or database. In Java, serialization is done by implementing the Serializable interfaceP
4. What is the Serializable interface in Java?

Ans: The Serializable interface in Java is a marker interface that has no methods. It is used to mark classes that 
can be serialized, meaning their object instances can be converted into a stream of bytesP
5. What is deserialization in Java?

Ans: Deserialization is the process of converting a stream of bytes back into an object instance. This is done 
after an object has been serializedP
6. How is serialization achieved in Java?

Ans: Serialization is achieved in Java by implementing the Serializable interface. When an object is serialized, its 
state is converted into a stream of bytes, which can then be transferred over a network or stored in a file or 
databaseP
7. How is deserialization achieved in Java?

Ans: Deserialization is achieved in Java by reading a stream of bytes and using them to recreate the original 
object instance. This is done by calling the readMbject() method of an MbjectInputStream instanceP
8. How can you avoid certain member variables of class from getting Serialized?

Ans: Mark member variables as static or transient, and those member variables will no more be a part of 
SerializationP
9. What classes are available in the Java IO File Classes API?

Ans: The following classes are available in the Java IM API and are important to work with files in JavaP
File

RandomAccessFile

FileInputStream

FileReader

FileMutputStream

FileWriter

10. What is Difference between Externalizable and Serialization interface ?

Ans:

Serializable Interface:

The Serializable interface is a marker interface, meaning it doesn't declare any methods.
When a class implements Serializable, it indicates that instances of that class can be serialized and deserialized.
Serialization and deserialization are handled automatically by the Java runtime.
All fields, including private ones, are serialized unless marked as transient.
Provides default serialization behavior.
It is simpler to use but provides less control over the serialization process.

Externalizable Interface:

The Externalizable interface extends Serializable but requires the implementation of two methods: writeExternal and readExternal.
This interface provides more control over the serialization process, allowing the class to define how its objects should be serialized and deserialized.
The class must explicitly specify what data should be serialized and in what format.
It is more complex to use than Serializable but allows for greater customization.
