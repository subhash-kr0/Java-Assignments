To solve the recurrence relation 
T(n)=T(n−1)+c using the substitution method, we'll make an initial guess and then use mathematical induction to prove our guess.

Guess:
T(n)=T(n−1)+c

Base Case:
Let's check the base case:

For 
n=1:
T(1)=T(1−1)+c=T(0)+c

Inductive Step:
Assume the hypothesis is true for 

n=k, i.e., 

T(k)=T(k−1)+c.

Now, let's prove it for 

n=k+1:

T(k+1)=T((k+1)−1)+c=T(k)+c

=(T(k−1)+c)+c=T(k−1)+2c

So, our assumption holds for 
n=k+1 as well.

Conclusion:
The solution to the recurrence relation 

T(n)=T(n−1)+c is 
T(n)=T(0)+nc, where 
T(0) is the initial condition.
